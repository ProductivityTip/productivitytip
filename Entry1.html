 <i> We’ve all experienced the dreaded “panic attack” whenever we leave the office or our favourite restaurant and we can’t seem to locate our phones and wallets anywhere. Fortunately, there’s a very simple way around this and by utilizing mnemonic devices you can remember exactly where you’ve placed these items. </i> 
 <br/ >
 <br/ >
 <strong> Mnemonic device </strong> - techniques a person can use to help them improve their ability to remember something. In other words, it's a memory technique to help your brain better encode and recall valuable information.
<br/ >
<br/ >
<p style="text-indent: 50px;"> To do this, use what’s called the number rhyme system and it goes like this “One is a gun; two is a shoe; three is a tree” so on and so forth. When going down the list of items, simply pair each object with the above rhyming scheme - make sure that it’s a vivid image so you can easily recall it. </p>
<br/ >
<p>
Here’s a sample list:
<br/ >
<br/ >
One :: Gun :: Phone
<br/ >
<br/ >
<p style="text-indent: 50px;">It’s safe to say that no one ever leaves the house without their phones. I imagine that dropping a gun onto the concrete creates a *thud* sound, the same noise that I would get if my smartphone fell out of my hands. </p>
<p>
<br/ >
  Two :: Shoe :: Keys
  <br/ >
  <br/ >
 <p style="text-indent: 50px;"> Try unlocking the doors without this. I imagine my shoestring going through the holes of all my keys.
</p>
<br/ >
<p>
  Three :: Tree :: Notebook
  <br/ >
  <br/ >
  <p style="text-indent: 50px;"> Whether you’re a student or having weekly meetings with your supervisor, having something to write on never does any harm. I imagine how trees are turned into paper used to make said notebook. 
</p>
  <br/ >
<p>
  Five :: Hive :: Wallet 
  <br/ >
  <br/ >
  <p style="text-indent: 50px;"> Imagine opening your wallet and a swarm of wasps and bees come flying out. 
</p>
 <br/ >
<p>
  Six :: Bricks :: Eyeglasses 
  <br/ >
  <br/ >
  <p style="text-indent: 50px;"> I’m legally required to wear my glasses whenever I drive. I imagine how my glasses would break if a concrete brick was dropped. 
</p>
  <br/ >
  <p>
    Seven :: Heaven :: insert your item here <br/ >
    Eight :: Crate :: insert your item here <br/ >
    Nine :: Wine :: insert your item here <br/ >
    Ten :: Hen :: insert your item here <br/ >
    <br/ >

    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">If you can count to 10 this is a great way for you to never lose your items again – just make sure to do so right before leaving school, the office, restaurant etc. If you want to learn another technique to better improve your memory recall then read <a style="color: blue" href="Entry2.html"> “Memory performance hack: Making mental journeys to effectively remember sequential information” </a>.
