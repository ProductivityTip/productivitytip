  <i> <p style="text-indent: 50px;"> Body language is an example of non-verbal communication where physical behaviours are used to express information. Research from UCLA has shown that 7% of communication is based on the words we say, while 55% comes from our body language. So the next time you’re in a meeting, giving a presentation or in a job interview remember a few of these cues to project confidence and credibility. </p> </i> <br/ >

  <ol>
  	<li> Standing tall and occupying space conveys confidence and power. Having an upright posture with your shoulders back and head held high will make you look sure of yourself. If you’re sitting you can look more confident by hooking one elbow on the back of your chair or spread out your belongings on a table to take up more space. </li>
  	<li> Widen your stance rather than having your feet close together – this makes you look more “solid” and confident. </li>
  	<li> Lower your vocal pitch when speaking to sound more confident the next time you’re on the phone, during an interview or in a weekly meeting. </li>
  	<li> Try to think of a past success and recall those memories and emotions – this way as you enter a meeting room or prepare to give a presentation, you’ll embody/recapture those emotions. 
 </li>
  	<li> Maintain eye contact. Whenever you meet someone, look into his or her eyes long enough to notice the color of their eyes. </li>
  	<li> Incorporate hand gestures in order to avoid the use of “ums” and “uhs” making what you want to say more declarative and clearer. </li>
  	<li> Individuals who show the palms of their hands when giving a presentation are perceived to be more positive and persuasive than those who are closed off. Body gestures you should avoid include crossed arms, hands are hidden or close to the body etc. </li>
  	<li> Reduce your nervous gestures. When we’re anxious and stressed we tend to do some form of self-touching like rubbing our hands, shaking your legs, twirling your hair etc. If you find yourself doing these, take a deep breath, set your feet flat to the ground and put the palm of your hands either on your lap or on the desk.  </li>
  	<li> Smiling not only conveys a state of your own wellbeing, it also makes people perceive you as approachable and trustworthy. </li>
  	<li> Perfecting the handshake. It takes 0.1 seconds to create a first impression so the next time you introduce yourself make sure you’ve perfected your handshake. This means no “dead fish” or the “iron grip”. Use a firm grip, fingers are underneath the receiving palm, hold no longer for 2-3 seconds, keep constant eye contact and smile.  </li>
  	<li> Strike a Power Pose. Research conducted at Harvard University on the effects of body posture on confidence has shown that holding your body in “high-power” poses for as little as two minutes made participants more confident and certain. These poses include leaning back on your chair with your hands behind your head and feet up on a desk or my favourite standing with your legs and arms stretched wide. Do this before your next job interview or presentation to feel more confident and less nervous. </li>
