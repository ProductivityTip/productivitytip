   <i> <p style="text-indent: 50px;"> In the <a style="color: blue" href="Entry1.html"> “Memory Performance Hack: How to Never Lose Your Wallet and Phone Again” </a>, the mnemonic system relied heavily on pegs to hang the information we want for better recall. For instance, using the number rhyming system we were able to pair information we wanted to remember with a list of “number rhyming objects”. For example, “one” rhymes with “gun” and I imagine that dropping a gun makes a *thud* noise similar to a smartphone being dropped.  </i>  <br/ ><br/ > </p>

   <p style="text-indent: 50px;"> Another technique to easily memorize sequential information uses places and objects as pegs, such as your room, a house, an office etc. If you can mentally visualize these places in a linear fashion, you can easily retrieve and unlock all sorts of information that you need. Whether you’re a student cramming for a midterm or you’re preparing to give a presentation, these so-called “memory palaces” are a great tool to improve your memorization skills. </p> <br/ > 

   <p style="text-indent: 50px;"> To do this, try to visualize a place or route that you’re very familiar with – it could be your home, the shops along a street that you walk by every day, your office etc. – just make sure you can mentally trace a path from start to finish. </p> <br/ >

  <p> Here’s an example:<br/ >

     <br/ >
(1)  Bedroom – this is where I begin my day <br/ >
(2) Bathroom – my first stop every morning <br/ >
(3) Kitchen – coffee and breakfast is made here <br/ >
(4) Front porch – go outside to get a breath of fresh air <br/ >
<br/ >
Let’s use this morning journey to memorize a list of items
<br/ ><br/ >
(1) Bedroom – Samsung Galaxy Smartphone <br/ >
<strong> The basket-ball in my room is shaped like the Death Star which is located in a Galaxy far far away as per George Lucas   </strong> <br/ >
(2) Bathroom - Wallet <br/ >
<strong> A water bill comes out of a faucet asking for a monthly payment    </strong> <br/ >
(3) Kitchen - Notebook <br/ >
<strong> The color of bread coming out the toaster is like the color of my moleskin notebook  </strong> <br/ >
(4) Front porch - Glasses <br/ >
<strong> A window cleaner cleaning the glass panes to increase my visibility        </strong> <br/ >
<br/ >
<p style="text-indent: 50px;"> The images are used to remind me of specific words and by no means should they have any logical connections to each other.
