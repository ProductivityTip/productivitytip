   <i> <p style="text-indent: 50px;"> We spend 70 to 80 percent of our waking hours in some sort of communication and more often than not it’s absolutely necessary to say things right the first time around. Below is a list of communication tricks to keep in mind when speaking from Bill McGowan’s “Pitch Perfect” book. Whether we’re pitching to a potential client, making small talk at the office, or asking the boss for a raise, it all starts with communication. </i>

   <ol>
     <li> When rehearsing or practicing for a speech never say “Let’s just start over” when you make a mistake. Try to force yourself through these “rough patches”, recover your train of thought and continue </li>
     <li>You’re the most nervous in the first 2 minutes of your speech – know your opening lines by heart </li>
     <li> When you’re nervous there’s the tendency to take shallow breaths that can lead to a “shaky-voice”. Do 3-4 deep yoga breaths before the talk to slow your pulse and relax </li>
     <li> Stand upright with your weight forward on the balls of your feet to avoid rocking and swaying </li>
     <li>Have a good night’s rest before giving a talk and never present on an empty stomach </li>
     <li> Avoid dairy products to prevent coughing and throat clearing  </li>
     <li> Practice where you are presenting to be familiar with the environment </li>
     <li> Try to introduce yourself to 4 people in the crowd prior to your presentation – this way you can keep your mind off the presentation and have familiar faces to make eye contact during the presentation</li>
     <li> Never have sentences with inherent apologies – “It’s 8am I know it’s really early but … “ </li>
     <li> Never talk about what you’re going to talk about – in other words don’t talk about your “Table of Content” – just go right in</li>
     <li> Brevity is good – how can you strip things down and remove unnecessary jargon in your speech? In other words, less is more </li>
     <li> The less certain you are about the next idea coming out of your mouth, the slower you should talk. </li>
     <li> Never have your hands in your pockets, above shoulder level, behind your back, crossed arms, or on your hips. Instead, create a right angle between your upper-arm and forearm at waist-level </li>
     <li> Avoid repetitive arm movements as they are distracting and can take away from your talk – avoid the “Politician air punch” </li>
     <li>  When trying to convey an important idea, slow down and pull back your voice for greater emphasis. Avoid the common mistake of making yourself louder.</li>
     <li>  Avoid writing a script. Record yourself and organically talk through what you will say and then transcribe it. This is an accurate version of how you actually talk conversationally which serves as a foundation for your speech</li>
     <li> At the end of a presentation it’s normal to have a Q&A session, come with your own first question to kick-start the Q&A </li>
     <li> Avoid being rattled by “hecklers” who are shouting things at you, instead, use phrases such as 
“What you say is a valid point, I’m more than happy to have this conversation with you after the presentation” or “I love the fact that you mentioned this but …”  
 </li>
     <li>Incorporate brief pauses rather than using words like “like, kind of, sort of etc.”  </li>
     <li> The most underrated advice in this list: Practice </li>
