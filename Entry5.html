  School shouldn’t be so difficult – here are 10 ways to help you dominate you classes. </i> <br /><br />  

  <ol>
    <li>When writing a paper avoid ending your day with a completed section. Instead, try writing a few sentences or thoughts for the next section to get started the following day</li>
     <li>Avoid using the term “very” in your vocabulary, opt for a better adjective to make up for it</li>
      <li>If you’re staying up all night to write your paper and hit “writer’s block”, do the bibliography to take your mind off the paper</li>
       <li>When learning a new language practice with reading children’s books and TV shows like you did when you were younger</li>
        <li>Replace the batteries on your calculator before writing your exams</li>
         <li>Save all your college/university course syllabi in case you ever decide to transfer to another school. This is can save you time and money from having to retake a course</li>
          <li>If you’re struggling with math or math-based courses like physics and chemistry avoid memorizing the formulas. You’ll gain a better understanding by knowing how the formulas were derived</li>
           <li>Try explaining difficult concepts and ideas to a classmate. If they understood your explanation then that’s a good indicator of how well you know the material</li>
            <li>When deciding on a college major, ignore the title of the major and focus on the classes you’ll be taking </li>
             <li>Need to proofread your paper for spelling and grammar? Copy and paste it into Google Translate and listen to it </li>
  </ol>
