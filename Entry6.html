  <i> <p style="text-indent: 50px;"> Here’s a “not-so-exhaustive” list of productivity hacks that you can utilize every day at home, school and even work – there’s always something you can learn to make your day that more productive. </i> <br> <br>
  <ol>
    <li>Do the thing you are least looking forward to first and the whole day will seem brighter and easier</li>
    <li>Use your bathroom as a white backdrop for professional photos</li>
    <li>If you struggle getting up in the morning, place a glass of water near your bed and drink it as soon as your alarm goes off to get over that hump</li>
    <li>When feeling overwhelmed with work write a to-do-list, it may not be as hectic as it feels once you have it on paper </li>
    <li>Invite people over to your house if you’re struggling to find motivation to clean your house </li>
    <li>When making a Pros and Cons list, assign a value from 1-5 (1- least important, 5-most important) to each listed item. At the end, add up all the value and see which list has more points. This allows you to make a more correctly weighted decision </li>
    <li>Copy and paste your essay onto Google Translate and have it read to you for spelling and grammar</li>
    <li>If you’re struggling to fall asleep avoid checking the time, the stress from not being able to sleep can keep you up. Leave the room and return only when you are tired – try reading, solving a puzzle or anything to take your mind off sleeping </li>
    <li>The 2 Minute Rule - If a task takes less than 2 minutes to complete it, do it right away to avoid procrastination  </li>
    <li>If you’re alone during Thanksgiving or the Winter Holidays, consider volunteering at a soup kitchen</li>
  </ol>
